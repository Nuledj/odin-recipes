    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Crepes are thin, delicate pancakes that can be filled with sweet or savory ingredients. Perfect for breakfast, dessert, or even a light meal.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>2 large <strong>eggs</strong></li>
        <li>half cup <strong>milk</strong></li>
        <li>half cup <strong>water</strong></li>
        <li>quarter taspoon <strong>salt</strong></li>
        <li>1 cup <strong>all-purpose flour</strong></li>
        <li>2 tablespoons <strong>butter</strong> ,melted</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>Whisk eggs, milk, water, and salt together in a large mixing bowl; add flour and butter and whisk vigorously until smooth.</li>
        <li>Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium-high heat. Pour or scoop the batter onto the pan, using approximately 1/4 cup for each crêpe. Tilt the pan with a circular motion so that the batter coats the surface evenly.</li>
        <li>Cook until the top of the crêpe is no longer wet and the bottom has turned light brown, 1 to 2 minutes. Run a spatula around the edge of the skillet to loosen the crêpe; flip and cook until the other side has turned light brown, about 1 minute more. Serve hot.</li>
